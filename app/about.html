      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Developer and Designer from Maryland, temporarily located in Pittsburgh, PA.
        I am currently a Student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving hard problems and learning new skils is what I live for. I have 
        a passion for design and implimentation.
        While computer engineering is not the typical background for web developer/designer it gives me a
        unique persective as a full stack developer who also enjoys design. I can see from the
        designer/user perspective why something should be a certain way and also from an
        implimenters persepctive about how some changes cause massive ripples in the code base.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also really enjoy code refactoring, testing, and debugging. Whether it's front-end
        (Scss, HTML, etc..) or complex graph algorithms I think I learn the most about how
        something work by refactoring code. It gives me an opportunity to really learn how
        all of the moving parts work and develope better solutions than currently exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally i'd like to find an internship for the summer of 2014 where I can either be
        some cross between a designer and developer (design in the browser maybe) or
        being able to jump into designing/reworking some really interesting code.
        If your looking for a summer 2014 intern send me an email: drewmland@gmail.com.
